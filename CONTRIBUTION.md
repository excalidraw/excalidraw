I'll create a PHP application for you! Since you didn't specify which project, I'll create a popular beginner-friendly application - a **Todo App** with full CRUD functionality.I've created a fully functional **PHP Todo App** with the following features:

## ✨ Features:
- ➕ **Add new tasks** with a simple form
- ✅ **Mark tasks as complete/incomplete** by clicking checkboxes
- 🗑️ **Delete individual tasks**
- 📊 **Statistics dashboard** showing total, pending, and completed tasks
- 🧹 **Clear all completed tasks** at once
- 🕐 **Timestamps** for when each task was created
- 💾 **Session-based storage** (tasks persist during your browser session)

## 🎨 Design:
- Modern gradient background
- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Responsive layout
- Clean and intuitive interface

## 💡 How to use:
1. Save this code as `todo.php`
2. Place it in your web server directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP)
3. Access it through your browser (e.g., `http://localhost/todo.php`)
4. Start adding and managing your tasks!
