# Optimize image priority

Browsers use heuristics to assign loading priorities to images, but these defaults may not always align with your page's Largest Contentful Paint (LCP). Using `fetchpriority` on an `<img>` element allows you to explicitly signal an image's importance to the browser, ensuring critical images load faster while non-essential ones don't compete for bandwidth.

## How to implement

1. **Identify the LCP image**: Determine which image is the most likely candidate for the Largest Contentful Paint (usually the hero image at the top of the page).
2. **Elevate LCP priority**: Add `fetchpriority="high"` to the `<img>` element for the LCP candidate.
3. **Deprioritize non-critical images**: For images that are part of a secondary UI or are only revealed after user interaction (like mega menus, modals, or off-screen carousel slides), add `fetchpriority="low"`.
4. **Optimize lazy loading**: Never use `loading="lazy"` on the LCP image. For standard below-the-fold images, `loading="lazy"` is sufficient to defer the request until the user scrolls near them. Avoid adding `fetchpriority="low"` to these images, as you want them to load at normal priority once the user scrolls to them. Reserve `fetchpriority="low"` for images that are technically "above the fold" but not initially visible (e.g., hidden carousel slides or mega menus). For these hidden images, it is acceptable to use `loading="lazy"` as well; the browser will handle the request timing while respecting the low priority.
5. **Prefer default priorities**: If an image should have normal loading priority, omit the `fetchpriority` attribute entirely rather than setting it to `auto`. This is a stylistic convention to keep your HTML cleaner while relying on the browser's native heuristics.

## Example code

```html
<!-- Elevate priority for the LCP image -->
<img src="/images/hero-lcp.jpg"
     alt="Main Banner"
     fetchpriority="high"
     width="800" height="400">

<!-- Deprioritize initially hidden images above the fold -->
<img src="/images/gallery-alt.jpg"
     alt="Gallery Image"
     fetchpriority="low"
     width="400" height="300">

<!-- Deprioritize images revealed only after user interaction -->
<img src="/images/mega-menu-promo.jpg"
     alt="Special Offer"
     fetchpriority="low"
     width="300" height="150">

<!-- Use lazy loading ALONE for standard below-the-fold images -->
<img src="/images/footer-logo.png"
     alt="Footer Logo"
     loading="lazy"
     width="120" height="60">

<!-- Omit fetchpriority for images with standard priority -->
<img src="/images/standard-image.jpg"
     alt="Standard Image"
     width="400" height="300">
```

## Best practices

- **MANDATORY**: Always apply `fetchpriority="high"` to the LCP image.
- **MANDATORY**: Only use `fetchpriority="high"` on at most 1-2 critical images to avoid network contention and diluting the priority boost.
- **MANDATORY**: Use `fetchpriority="low"` for images that are technically "above the fold" but initially hidden (e.g., hidden carousel slides, mega menu images).
- **MANDATORY**: **Do not** use `fetchpriority="low"` on standard below-the-fold images that are already using `loading="lazy"`. These images should load at normal priority once they enter the viewport.
- **RECOMMENDED**: Avoid using `fetchpriority="auto"`. If you want the default priority, omit the attribute entirely to keep your HTML clean.
- **DO NOT** combine `fetchpriority="high"` with `loading="lazy"` for the LCP image.
- **DO NOT** use the deprecated `importance` attribute. It has been replaced by `fetchpriority` and is not supported by any browser.

## Fallback strategy

Baseline status for Fetch priority: Newly available. It's been Baseline since 2024-10-29.
Supported by: Chrome 103 (Jun 2022), Edge 103 (Jun 2022), Firefox 132 (Oct 2024), and Safari 17.2 (Dec 2023).

The `fetchpriority` attribute is a progressive enhancement for the `<img>` element. If a browser does not support it, the attribute is ignored, and the browser uses its default priority heuristics.
