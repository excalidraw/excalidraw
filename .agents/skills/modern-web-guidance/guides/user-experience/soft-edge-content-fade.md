## Overview
To apply a transparency gradient to the edges of a container (e.g., to indicate more content is available to scroll or to fade out text), use CSS Masking with a linear gradient. This approach is superior to using a semi-transparent overlay because it actually fades the content itself, allowing the background to show through naturally without interfering with text selection or pointer events.

## Implementation
To implement a soft edge fade:

### Fading the bottom edge of a container
This is useful for indicating that there is more content below in a scrollable area.

```css
.container {
  /* Enable scrolling */
  overflow-y: auto;
  
  /* MANDATORY: Use vendor prefix for wider support in older browsers */
  -webkit-mask-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, black 80%, transparent 100%);
  
  /* Standard property for modern browsers */
  mask-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, black 80%, transparent 100%);
}
```

### Fading both top and bottom edges
You can use a single gradient with multiple color stops to fade both edges.

```css
.dual-fade-container {
  /* Content is visible between 10% and 90% of the height */
  -webkit-mask-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent 0%, black 10%, black 90%, transparent 100%);
  mask-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent 0%, black 10%, black 90%, transparent 100%);
}
```

## Fallback strategies
Baseline status for Masks: Newly available. It's been Baseline since 2023-12-07.
Supported by: Chrome 120 (Dec 2023), Edge 120 (Dec 2023), Firefox 53 (Apr 2017), and Safari 15.4 (Mar 2022).

If a browser does not support `mask-image` or the prefixed version:
- The content will not fade and will display with sharp edges.
- Ensure the interface is still functional and content is readable without the fade (progressive enhancement).
- You can use a semi-transparent overlay as a fallback, but be aware it requires knowing the background color and may interfere with text selection unless `pointer-events: none` is used.

```css
/* Fallback using an overlay for browsers that do not support masking */
@supports (not (mask-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, black, transparent))) and (not (-webkit-mask-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, black, transparent))) {
  .container {
    position: relative;
  }
  
  .container::after {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    height: 20%;
    /* Fallback assumes a solid background color (e.g., white) */
    background: linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(255,255,255,0), rgba(255,255,255,1));
    pointer-events: none; /* Allow interaction with text underneath */
  }
}
```
