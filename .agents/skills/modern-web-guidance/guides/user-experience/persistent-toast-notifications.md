# Creating Toast Notifications

Toast notifications are transient status messages. Unlike menus, they should not close when a user interacts with other parts of the page. The popover="manual" state is ideal because it lacks "light-dismiss" behavior and allows multiple notifications to coexist.

### Implementation Guidelines

* **MANDATORY:** Use popover="manual" so the notification stays visible until explicitly closed or timed out by a script.
* **DO** use a container to manage the stacking of multiple toasts. Since popovers in the Top Layer ignore parent z-index, you must position them individually or within a common layout group.
* **DO** use sibling-index() to add margin between toast notifications so that items lower in the stack are visible.
* **DO** provide an explicit "Close" button within the toast using popovertargetaction="hide".
* **DO** use JavaScript for auto-dismissal timers (e.g., calling hidePopover() after 3000ms).
* **DO** utilize transition-behavior: allow-discrete to animate the entry and exit from the Top Layer.

### Fallback Strategies

#### popover

* **Guidance:** Use the [Popover Polyfill](https://github.com/oddbird/popover-polyfill). For legacy browsers, fall back to a fixed-position div with a high z-index.

#### sibling-index()

* **Guidance:** If sibling-index() is not supported, use the `+` operator to add margin manually. I.e. `popover + popover { margin-top: 1rem }`

#### anchor-positioning

* **Guidance:** Use the [CSS Anchor Positioning Polyfill](https://github.com/oddbird/css-anchor-positioning). For a non-polyfill fallback, default the tooltip to a fixed position at the bottom of the viewport using `@supports not (anchor-name: --foo)`.

#### transition-behavior

* **Guidance:** If transition-behavior is not supported, use JavaScript to add animation via classes as the toast element transitions in and out.
