Elements that render in the "top layer" (like `<dialog>`, elements with the `popover` attribute, or tooltips) have historically been difficult to animate because they toggle between `display: none` and a visible state. Modern CSS provides `@starting-style`, `transition-behavior: allow-discrete`, and the `overlay` property to enable smooth entry and exit transitions for these elements. Note that native CSS nesting is used in the examples below.

## Implementation

### 1. Enable Discrete Transitions

To animate the `display` property, you must set `transition-behavior: allow-discrete`. This allows the element to remain visible during its exit transition. If using transition shorthands, be sure to place the `transition-behavior: allow-discrete` afterwards to prevent the shorthand from negating it.

### 2. The `overlay` Property

When an element moves in or out of the top layer, it must transition the `overlay` property. This ensures the element stays in the top layer for the duration of the animation, preventing it from being clipped by other elements or the viewport prematurely.

### 3. Entry Animations with `@starting-style`

Use the `@starting-style` at-rule to define the styles an element should transition *from* when it is first rendered or its `display` changes from `none`.

### 4. Animating the Backdrop

The `::backdrop` pseudo-element can be animated similarly by applying transitions to its own properties.

## Example

```css
/* 1. Define the visible (open) state */
dialog[open],
[popover]:popover-open {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: scale(1);

  /* 2. Define the starting state for entry (must come after open state) */
  @starting-style {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: scale(0.9);
  }
}

/* 3. Define the base (closed/exit) state and transitions */
dialog,
[popover] {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: scale(0.9);

  /* MANDATORY: transition display and overlay for top-layer elements */
  transition-property: opacity, transform, display, overlay;
  transition-duration: 0.3s;
  transition-timing-function: ease-out;
  /* Applies to discrete properties like display and overlay */
  transition-behavior: allow-discrete; /* Note: be sure to write this after the shorthand */
}

/* 4. Animate the backdrop */
dialog::backdrop,
[popover]::backdrop {
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);
  /* The transition shorthand can also be used with allow-discrete */
  transition:
    display 0.3s allow-discrete,
    overlay 0.3s allow-discrete,
    background-color 0.3s ease-out;
}

dialog[open]::backdrop,
[popover]:popover-open::backdrop {
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);

  @starting-style {
    background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);
  }
}

/* 5. Respect user preference for reduced motion */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  dialog,
  [popover] {
    /* Disable movement and shorten duration for a simple fade */
    transform: none;
    transition-duration: 0.1s;
  }

  @starting-style {
    dialog[open],
    [popover]:popover-open {
      transform: none;
    }
  }
}
```

## Constraints & Accessibility

- **MANDATORY**: Include `overlay` in your `transition` list for any element moving into or out of the top layer.
- **MANDATORY**: Use `allow-discrete` for the `display` property transition.
- **MANDATORY**: Respect user preferences for reduced motion using `prefers-reduced-motion` by simplifying transitions (e.g., removing transforms and shortening duration).
- **DO**: Place the `@starting-style` block inside or after the "open" state selector to ensure proper cascading.
- **DO NOT**: Use `@starting-style` for exit animations; exit animations are defined by the transition to the base (closed) state.

## Fallback strategies

#### Top-layer animation features

Baseline status for @starting-style: Newly available. It's been Baseline since 2024-08-06.
Supported by: Chrome 117 (Sep 2023), Edge 117 (Sep 2023), Firefox 129 (Aug 2024), and Safari 17.5 (May 2024).
Baseline status for transition-behavior: Newly available. It's been Baseline since 2024-08-06.
Supported by: Chrome 117 (Sep 2023), Edge 117 (Sep 2023), Firefox 129 (Aug 2024), and Safari 17.4 (Mar 2024).
overlay has limited availability.
Supported by: Chrome 117 (Sep 2023) and Edge 117 (Sep 2023).
Unsupported in: Firefox and Safari.

For browsers that do not support these features, top-layer elements will appear and disappear instantly. To provide animations in older browsers, you must use JavaScript to coordinate classes and wait for `transitionend` events or use the Web Animations API.

```javascript
// Feature detection for top-layer animations
const supportsTopLayerAnimation =
  window.CSS &&
  CSS.supports('transition-behavior', 'allow-discrete') &&
  CSS.supports('overlay', 'auto');

if (!supportsTopLayerAnimation) {
  // Manual JS fallback for entry/exit animations:
  // 1. Add an `.is-opening` class for entry.
  // 2. On close, add an `.is-closing` class, wait for the `transitionend` event, then call .close() or hide the popover.
}
```

#### popover

Baseline status for Popover: Newly available. It's been Baseline since 2025-01-27.
Supported by: Chrome 116 (Aug 2023), Edge 116 (Aug 2023), Firefox 125 (Apr 2024), Safari 17 (Sep 2023), and Safari iOS 18.3 (Jan 2025).

If the browser does not support Popover, use the `@oddbird/popover-polyfill`:

```html
<script type="module">
  if (!HTMLElement.prototype.hasOwnProperty('popover')) {
    await import('https://unpkg.com/@oddbird/popover-polyfill');
  }
</script>
```

Alternatively, for legacy support without a polyfill, use `position: fixed` and manually calculate coordinates via JavaScript `getBoundingClientRect()`.
