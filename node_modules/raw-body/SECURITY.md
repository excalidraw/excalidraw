# Security Policies and Procedures

## Reporting a Bug

The `raw-body` team and community take all security bugs seriously. Thank you
for improving the security of Express. We appreciate your efforts and
responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your
contributions.

Report security bugs by emailing the current owners of `raw-body`. This information
can be found in the npm registry using the command `npm owner ls raw-body`.
If unsure or unable to get the information from the above, open an issue
in the [project issue tracker](https://github.com/stream-utils/raw-body/issues)
asking for the current contact information.

To ensure the timely response to your report, please ensure that the entirety
of the report is contained within the email body and not solely behind a web
link or an attachment.

At least one owner will acknowledge your email within 48 hours, and will send a
more detailed response within 48 hours indicating the next steps in handling
your report. After the initial reply to your report, the owners will
endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full
announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.
