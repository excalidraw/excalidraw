## [Unreleased]

## Excalidraw API

### Features

- Allow host to pass [color](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/types.ts#L36) for [collaborator](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/types.ts#L27) [#2943](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2943). The unused prop `user` is now removed.
- Add `zenModeEnabled` and `gridModeEnabled` prop which enables zen mode and grid mode respectively [#2901](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2901). When this prop is used, the zen mode / grid mode will be fully controlled by the host app.
- Add `viewModeEnabled` prop which enabled the view mode [#2840](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2840). When this prop is used, the view mode will not show up in context menu is so it is fully controlled by host.
- Expose `getAppState` on `excalidrawRef` [#2834](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2834).

### Build

- Remove publicPath so host can use `__webpack_public_path__` to host the assets[#2835](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2835)

## Excalidraw Library

### Features

- Add view mode [#2840](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2840).
- Remove `copy`, `cut`, and `paste` actions from contextmenu [#2872](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2872)
- Support `Ctrl-Y` shortcut to redo on Windows [#2831](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2831).

### Fixes

- Fix UI pointer-events not disabled when dragging on canvas [#2856](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2856).
- Fix remote pointers not accounting for offset [#2855](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2855).

## 0.2.1

## Excalidraw API

### Build

- Bundle css files with js [#2819](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2819). The host would not need to import css files separately.

## 0.2.0

## Excalidraw API

### Features

- Exported few [Extra API's](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#extra-apis) which can be used by the host to communicate with Excalidraw.

- Remove language picker, and add `langCode`, `renderFooter` [#2644](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2644):
  - BREAKING: removed the language picker from UI. It is now the host app's responsibility to implement a language picker if desirable, using the newly added [`renderFooter`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#renderFooter) prop. The reasoning is that the i18n should be controlled by the app itself, not by the nested Excalidraw component.
  - Added [`langCode`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#langCode) prop to control the UI language.
- Add support for `exportToBackend` prop to allow host apps to implement shareable links [#2612](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2612/files)

### Fixes

- Hide collaboration button when the prop `onCollabButtonClick` is not provided [#2598](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2598)
