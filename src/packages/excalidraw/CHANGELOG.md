## Unreleased

**This changes are not yet released but you can still try it out in [@excalidraw/excalidraw-next](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@excalidraw/excalidraw-next).**

## Excalidraw API

### Features

- Expose [`FONT_FAMILY`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#FONT_FAMILY) so that consumer can use when passing `initialData.appState.currentItemFontFamily`.

- Added prop [`autoFocus`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#autoFocus) to focus the excalidraw component on page load when enabled, defaults to false [#3691](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3691).

  Note: Earlier Excalidraw component was focussed by default on page load, you need to enable `autoFocus` prop to retain the same behaviour.

- Added prop `UIOptions.canvasActions.export.renderCustomUI` to support Custom UI rendering inside export dialog [#3666](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3666).
- Added prop `UIOptions.canvasActions.saveAsImage` to show/hide the **Save as image** button in the canvas actions. Defauls to `true` hence the **Save as Image** button is rendered [#3662](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3662).

- Export dialog can be customised with [`UiOptions.canvasActions.export`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#exportOpts) [#3658](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3658).

  Also, [`UIOptions`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#UIOptions) is now memoized to avoid unnecessary rerenders.

#### BREAKING CHANGE

- `UIOptions.canvasActions.saveAsScene` is now renamed to `UiOptions.canvasActions.export.saveFileToDisk`. Defaults to `true` hence the **save file to disk** button is rendered inside the export dialog.
- `exportToBackend` is now renamed to `UIOptions.canvasActions.export.exportToBackend`. If this prop is not passed, the **shareable-link** button will not be rendered, same as before.

### Fixes

- Use excalidraw Id in elements so every element has unique id [#3696](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3696).

### Refactor

- #### BREAKING CHANGE
  - Rename `UIOptions.canvasActions.saveScene` to `UIOptions.canvasActions.saveToActiveFile`[#3657](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3657).
  - Removed `shouldAddWatermark: boolean` attribute from options for [export](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#export-utilities) APIs [#3639](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3639).
  - Removed `appState.shouldAddWatermark` so in case you were passing `shouldAddWatermark` in [initialData.AppState](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/types.ts#L42) it will not work anymore.

## 0.8.0 (2021-05-15)

## Excalidraw API

**_These section lists the updates which may affect your integration, so it is recommended to go through this when upgrading the version._**

### Features

- Support updating any `appState` properties in [`updateScene`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/components/App.tsx#L282) API. Earlier only `appState.viewBackgroundColor` was supported, now any attribute can be updated with this API.
- Expose [`serializeAsJSON`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#serializeAsJSON) helper that we use when saving Excalidraw scene to a file [#3538](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3538).
- Add support to render custom UI in the top right corner via [`renderTopRightUI`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#renderTopRightUI) prop [#3539](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3539), [#3572](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3572) .

  This also removes the GitHub icon, keeping it local to the https://excalidraw.com app.

### Fixes

- The encryption shield icon is now removed from excalidraw package as it was specific to excalidraw app and is now rendered via [`renderFooter`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#renderFooter) prop. In case you were hiding this icon earlier, you need not do that anymore [#3577](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3577).

  Now `appState` is also passed to [`renderFooter`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#renderFooter) prop.

## Excalidraw Library

**_These section lists the updates made to the excalidraw library and will not affect the integration._**

### Features

- Shortcut key for nerd stats [#3552](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3552).
- Better rendering of curved rectangles [#3562](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3562).
- Improved freedraw [#3512](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3512).
- Add shortcut for dark mode [#3543](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3543).
- Adds rounded icons, joins and caps.[#3521](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3521).

### Fixes

- Handle render errors [#3557](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3557).
- Restore on paste or lib import [#3558](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3558).
- Improve mobile user experience [#3508](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3508).
- Prevent selecting `.visually-hidden` elements [#3501](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3501).

### Perf

- Reduce SVG export size by more than half by reducing precision to 2 decimal places [#3567](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3567).
- Remove `backdrop-filter` to improve perf [#3506](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3506)

## 0.7.0 (2021-04-26)

## Excalidraw API

### Features

- [`scrollToContent`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/components/App.tsx#L265) API now supports passing just a single Excalidraw element, or none at all (which will default to current elements on the scene) [#3482](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3482).

  #### BREAKING CHANGE

  - Renamed `setScrollToContent` to [`scrollToContent`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/components/App.tsx#L265).

- Make library local to given excalidraw instance (previously, all instances on the same page shared one global library) [#3451](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3451).

  - Added prop [onLibraryChange](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#onLibraryChange) which if supplied will be called when library is updated.

  - Added attribute `libraryItems` to prop [initialData](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#initialdata) which can be used to load excalidraw with existing library items.

  - Assign a [unique id](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#Id) to the excalidraw component. The id can be accessed via [`ref`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/components/App.tsx#L298).

  #### BREAKING CHANGE

  - From now on the host application is responsible for [persisting the library](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#onLibraryChange) to LocalStorage (or elsewhere), and [importing it on mount](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#initialdata).

- Bind the keyboard events to component and added a prop [`handleKeyboardGlobally`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#handleKeyboardGlobally) which if set to true will bind the keyboard events to document [#3430](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3430).

  #### BREAKING CHANGE

  - Earlier keyboard events were bind to document but now its bind to Excalidraw component by default. So you will need to set [`handleKeyboardGlobally`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#handleKeyboardGlobally) to true if you want the previous behaviour (bind the keyboard events to document).

- Recompute offsets on `scroll` of the nearest scrollable container [#3408](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3408). This can be disabled by setting [`detectScroll`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#detectScroll) to `false`.

- Add `onPaste` prop to handle custom clipboard behaviours [#3420](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3420).

### Fixes

- Changing z-index of elements (sorting them below/above other elements) now updates their `version` and `versionNonce` (only applies to the selected elements). This fix will allow you account for z-index changes if you're syncing just the elements that changed (and not the whole scene) [#3483](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3483).
- Only handle cut/paste events inside excalidraw [#3484](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3484).

- Make history local to a given Excalidraw instance. This fixes a case where history was getting shared when you have multiple Excalidraw components on the same page [#3481](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3481).
- Use active Excalidraw component when editing text. This fixes a case where text editing was not working when you have multiple Excalidraw components on the same page [#3478](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3478).

- Fix library being pasted off-center [#3462](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3462).

- When switching theme, apply it only to the active Excalidraw component. This fixes a case where the theme was getting applied to the first Excalidraw component if you had multiple Excalidraw components on the same page [#3446](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3446).

### Refactor

- #### BREAKING CHANGE

  - Removed exposing `getSyncableElements` helper which was specific to excalidraw app collab implementation [#3471](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3471). If you happened to use it, you can easily reimplement it yourself using the newly exposed [isInvisiblySmallElement](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#isInvisiblySmallElement) helper:

    ```ts
    const getSyncableElements = (elements: readonly ExcalidrawElement[]) =>
      elements.filter((el) => el.isDeleted || !isInvisiblySmallElement(el));
    ```

### Build

- Add vendor prefixes to css rules [#3476](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3476).

## Types

- Renamed the following types in case you depend on them (via [#3427](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3427)):
  - `DataState` → `ExportedDataState`
  - `LibraryData` → `ExportedLibraryData`

## Excalidraw Library

### Features

- Support tab-to-indent when editing text [#3411](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3411).

- App now breaks into mobile view using the component dimensions, not viewport dimensions. This fixes a case where the app would break sooner than necessary when the component's size is smaller than viewport [#3414](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3414).

- Add screenshots to manifest.json [#3369](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3369).

- Enable drop event on the whole component [#3406](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3406).

### Fixes

- Focus on last active element when dialog closes [#3447](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3447).

- Fix incorrectly caching png file handle [#3407](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3407).

- Fix popover position incorrect on Safari for non-zero offsets/scroll [#3399](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3399).

## 0.6.0 (2021-04-04)

## Excalidraw API

### Features

- Add `UIOptions` prop to customise `canvas actions` which includes customising `background color picker`, `clear canvas`, `export`, `load`, `save`, `save as` & `theme toggle` [#3364](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3364). Check the [readme](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#uioptions) for more details.
- Calculate `width/height` of canvas based on excalidraw component (".excalidraw" selector) & also resize and update offsets whenever the dimensions of excalidraw component gets updated [#3379](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3379). You also don't need to add a resize handler anymore for excalidraw as its handled now in excalidraw itself.
  #### BREAKING CHANGE
  - `width/height` props have been removed. Instead now it takes `100%` of `width` and `height` of the container so you need to make sure the container in which you are rendering Excalidraw has non zero dimensions (It should have non zero width and height so Excalidraw can match the dimensions of containing block)
- Calculate offsets when excalidraw container resizes using resize observer api [#3374](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3374).
- Export types for the package so now it can be used with typescript [#3337](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3337). The types are available at `@excalidraw/excalidraw/types`.
- Add `renderCustomStats` prop to render extra stats on host, and expose `setToastMessage` API via refs which can be used to show toast with custom message [#3360](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3360).
- Support passing a CSRF token when importing libraries to prevent prompting before installation. The token is passed from [https://libraries.excalidraw.com](https://libraries.excalidraw.com/) using the `token` URL key [#3329](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3329).
- #### BREAKING CHANGE
  Use `location.hash` when importing libraries to fix installation issues. This will require host apps to add a `hashchange` listener and call the newly exposed `excalidrawAPI.importLibrary(url)` API when applicable [#3320](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3320). Check the [readme](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#importlibrary) for more details.
- Append `location.pathname` to `libraryReturnUrl` default url [#3325](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3325).

### Build

- Expose separate builds for dev and prod and support source maps in dev build [#3330](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3330). Check the [readme](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#installation) for more details.
  #### BREAKING CHANGE
  - If you are using script tag to embed excalidraw then the name of the file will have to be updated to `excalidraw.production.min.js` instead of `excalidraw.min.js`. If you want to use dev build you can use `excalidraw.development.js`

### Refactor

#### BREAKING CHANGE

- Rename the API `setCanvasOffsets` exposed via [`ref`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/components/App.tsx#L265) to `refresh` [#3398](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3398).

## Excalidraw Library

### Features

- Reopen library menu on import from file [#3383](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3383).
- Don't unnecessarily prompt when installing libraries [#3329](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3329).
- Add option to flip single element on the context menu [#2520](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2520).
- Replace fontSize and fontFamily text with icons [#2857](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2857).

### Fixes

- Export dialog canvas positioning [#3397](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3397).
- Don't share collab types with core [#3353](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3353).
- Support d&d of files without extension [#3168](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3168).
- Positions stats for linear elements [#3331](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3331).
- Debounce.flush invokes func even if never queued before [#3326](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3326).
- State selection state on opening contextMenu [#3333](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3333).
- Add unique key for library header to resolve dev warnings [#3316](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3316).
- disallow create text in viewMode on mobile [#3219](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3219).
- Make help toggle tabbable [#3310](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3310)
- Show Windows share icon for Windows users [#3306](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3306).
- Don't scroll to content on INIT websocket message [#3291](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3291).

### Refactor

- Use arrow function where possible [#3315](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3315).

---

## 0.5.0 (2021-03-21)

## Excalidraw API

### Features

- Set the target to `window.name` if present during excalidraw libraries installation so it opens in same tab for the host. If `window.name` is not set it will open in a new tab [#3299](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3299).
- Add `name` prop to indicate the name of the drawing which will be used when exporting the drawing. When supplied, the value takes precedence over `intialData.appState.name`, the `name` will be fully controlled by host app and the users won't be able to edit from within Excalidraw [#3273](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3273).
- Export API `setCanvasOffsets` via `ref` to set the offsets for Excalidraw[#3265](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3265).
  #### BREAKING CHANGE
  - `offsetLeft` and `offsetTop` props have been removed now so you have to use the `setCanvasOffsets` via `ref` to achieve the same.
- Export API to export the drawing to canvas, svg and blob [#3258](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3258). For more info you can check the [readme](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/tree/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#user-content-export-utils)
- Add a `theme` prop to indicate Excalidraw's theme. [#3228](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3228). When this prop is passed, the theme is fully controlled by host app.
- Support `libraryReturnUrl` prop to indicate what URL to install libraries to [#3227](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3227).

### Refactor

- #### BREAKING CHANGE
  - Rename prop `initialData.scrollToCenter` and `setScrollToCenter` API exposed via ref to `initialData.scrollToContent` and `setScrollToContent` respectively[#3261](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3261).
- Rename appearance to theme [#3237](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3237).
  #### BREAKING CHANGE
  - Since `appState.appearance` is renamed to `appState.theme` so wherever `appState.appearance` including `initialData.appState.appearance` should be renamed to `appState.theme` and `initialData.appState.theme` respectively. If the `appearance` was persisted earlier, now it needs to passed as `theme`.
  - The class `Appearance_dark` is renamed to `theme--dark`.
  - The class `Appearance_dark-background-none` is renamed to `theme--dark-background-none`.

- Implement the Web Share Target API [#3230](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3230).

### Fixes

- Don't show export and delete when library is empty [#3288](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3288)
- Overflow in textinput in export dialog [#3284](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3284).
- Bail on noop updates for newElementWith [#3279](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3279).

## 0.4.3 (2021-03-12)

## Excalidraw API

### Fixes

- Allow copy of excalidraw elements only when inside excalidraw [#3206](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3206).
- Position text editor absolute and fix the offsets so it doesn't remain fixed when the container is scrolled [#3200](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3200).
- Scope CSS variables so that host CSS vars don't clash with excalidraw [#3199](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3199).

## Excalidraw Library

- Don't overflow text beyond width of Excalidraw [#3215](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3215).

---

## 0.4.2

## Excalidraw API

### Fixes

- Wrap excalidraw in position relative so host need not do it anymore & hide scrollbars in zen mode [#3174](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3174).
- Reduce the scroll debounce timeout to `100ms` so `offsets` gets updated faster if changed when container scrolled [#3182](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3182).
- Rerender UI on `renderFooter` prop change [#3183](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3183)

## Excalidraw Library

### Fixes

- Temporarily downgrade browser-fs-access to fix legacy FS API [#3172](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3172)

---

## 0.4.1

## Excalidraw API

### Fixes

- Use `Array.from` when spreading over set so that typescript transpiles correctly in the umd build[#3165](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3165).

## Excalidraw Library

### Features

- Add export info on copy PNG to clipboard toast message [#3159](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3159).
- Use the latest version of Virgil [#3124](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3124).
- Support exporting with dark mode [#3046](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3046).

### Fixes

- Cursor being leaked outside of canvas [#3161](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3161).
- Hide scrollbars in zenMode [#3144](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3144).

## 0.4.0

## Excalidraw API

### Features

- Expose `window.EXCALIDRAW_ASSET_PATH` which host can use to load assets from a different URL. By default it will be loaded from `https://unpkg.com/@excalidraw/excalidraw{currentVersion}/dist/`[#3068](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3068).

  Also now the assets will have a hash in filename so cache bursting can easily happen with version bump.

- Add support for `scrollToCenter` in [initialData](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/element/types.ts#L18) so host can control whether to scroll to center on mount [#3070](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3070).

- Export [`restore`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/data/restore.ts#L182), [`restoreAppState`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/data/restore.ts#L144) and [`restoreElements`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/data/restore.ts#L128) to host [#3049](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3049)

### Fixes

- Show user state only when [userState](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/types.ts#L35) is passed on remote pointers during collaboration [#3050](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3050)

- Allow host to pass [userState](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/6967d8c9851c65bb8873e2f97387749976bbe326/src/types.ts#L35) for [collaborator](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/types.ts#L27) to show the current user state [#2877](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2877).
- Add `viewModeEnabled` prop which enabled the view mode [#2840](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2840). When this prop is used, the view mode will not show up in context menu is so it is fully controlled by host.
- Expose `getAppState` on `excalidrawRef` [#2834](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2834).

### Chore

## 0.2.1

## Excalidraw API

### Build

- Bundle css files with js [#2819](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2819). The host would not need to import css files separately.

## 0.2.0

## Excalidraw API

### Features

- Exported few [Extra API's](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#extra-apis) which can be used by the host to communicate with Excalidraw.

- Remove language picker, and add `langCode`, `renderFooter` [#2644](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2644):
  - BREAKING: removed the language picker from UI. It is now the host app's responsibility to implement a language picker if desirable, using the newly added [`renderFooter`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#renderFooter) prop. The reasoning is that the i18n should be controlled by the app itself, not by the nested Excalidraw component.
  - Added [`langCode`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#langCode) prop to control the UI language.
- Add support for `exportToBackend` prop to allow host apps to implement shareable links [#2612](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2612/files)

- Hide collaboration button when the prop `onCollabButtonClick` is not provided [#2598](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2598)
