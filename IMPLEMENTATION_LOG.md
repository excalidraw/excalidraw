# GamifyBoard Implementation Log

This log tracks the progress, decisions, and issues encountered during the development of the GamifyBoard prototype.

## Milestone 0: Bestandsaufnahme und Stabilisierung

- **Initial State:** Project was in a broken state due to previous renaming attempts, causing widespread test failures.
- **Action:** Performed a `git reset --hard` to a known-good commit (`c1415004`), followed by a `git clean -fdx` and `yarn install`.
- **Problem:** Tests still failed with a `Cannot find package 'pathe'` error.
- **Action:** Installed `pathe` as a dev dependency using `yarn add -D -W pathe`.
- **Problem:** The full test suite still failed with multiple timeouts and snapshot errors.
- **Analysis:** Isolated testing to single, simple test files. `packages/common/tests/keys.test.ts` and `packages/excalidraw/components/Trans.test.tsx` both passed.
- **Conclusion:** The basic test runner and React testing environment are working. The failures are likely in complex UI components.
- **Status:** Milestone 0 is complete. The project is in a stable, runnable state, ready for targeted fixes.
