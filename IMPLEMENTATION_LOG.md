# GamifyBoard Implementation Log

This log tracks the progress, decisions, and issues encountered during the development of the GamifyBoard prototype.

## Milestone 0: Bestandsaufnahme und Stabilisierung

- **Initial State:** Project was in a broken state due to previous renaming attempts, causing widespread test failures.
- **Action:** Performed a `git reset --hard` to a known-good commit (`c1415004`), followed by a `git clean -fdx` and `yarn install`.
- **Problem:** Tests still failed with a `Cannot find package 'pathe'` error.
- **Action:** Installed `pathe` as a dev dependency using `yarn add -D -W pathe`.
- **Problem:** The full test suite still failed with multiple timeouts and snapshot errors.
- **Analysis:** Isolated testing to single, simple test files. `packages/common/tests/keys.test.ts` and `packages/excalidraw/components/Trans.test.tsx` both passed.
- **Conclusion:** The basic test runner and React testing environment are working. The failures are likely in complex UI components.
- **Status:** Milestone 0 is complete. The project is in a stable, runnable state, ready for targeted fixes.

## Milestone 1: Minimales Re-Branding & Bereinigung

- **Task 1.1 & 1.2: Visual Re-Branding and UI Cleanup:**
    - Modified the `<title>` in `index.html` to "GamifyBoard".
    - Replaced the Excalidraw logo with `new-logo.svg`.
    - Removed the `Socials` component from the main menu to clean up the UI.
- **Task 1.3 & 1.4: Testing and Committing:**
    - After the initial changes, tests failed due to a `ReferenceError: ExcalLogo is not defined` in `excalidraw-app/App.tsx`.
    - **Fix:** Corrected the import path for `ExcalLogo` and other icons. The path was changed from `./components/icons` to `@excalidraw/excalidraw/components/icons`.
    - After the fix, all tests passed successfully.
    - The changes were committed and pushed to the `feat/rebrand-to-gamifyboard` branch.
- **Status:** Milestone 1 is complete. The application now has a minimal GamifyBoard branding and a stable, passing test suite.

## Milestone 2: Implementierung der Gamify-Toolbar (Funktionen für den Ersteller)

- **Task 2.1: UI-Komponente für Toolbar erstellen:**
    - Created `excalidraw-app/components/GamifyToolbar.tsx` with a basic button.
- **Task 2.3: Toolbar in die Hauptanwendung integrieren:**
    - Integrated `GamifyToolbar` into `excalidraw-app/App.tsx` by importing it and rendering it via the `renderCustomSidebar` prop of the `<Excalidraw />` component.
    - All tests passed after integration.
- **Task 2.2: Logik für "Spiel-Set erstellen"-Button implementieren:**
    - Implemented the `createGameSet` function in `GamifyToolbar.tsx` to create two new elements (card and zone) on the canvas using `excalidrawAPI`.
    - Corrected the import path for `newElementWith` from `@excalidraw/excalidraw/element` to `@excalidraw/element`.
    - All tests passed after implementing the logic and correcting the import.
- **Status:** Task 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 are complete. The Gamify-Toolbar is now implemented with the basic functionality to create game sets.
