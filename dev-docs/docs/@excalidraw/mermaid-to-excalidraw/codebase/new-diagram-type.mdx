# Adding a new Diagram Type

To add a new diagram type to the parser you can follow the below steps :point_down:

All the code for the parser resides in [`src`](https://github.com/excalidraw/mermaid-to-excalidraw/tree/master/src) folder and for playground resides in [`playground`](https://github.com/excalidraw/mermaid-to-excalidraw/tree/master/playground) folder.

lets run the playground server in local :point_down:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will start the playground server in port `1234` and open it in browser so  you start playing with the playground.

## Update Supported Diagram Types

First step is to add the new diagram type in [`SUPPORTED_DIAGRAM_TYPES`](https://github.com/excalidraw/mermaid-to-excalidraw/blob/master/src/constants.ts#L2).

Once this is done the new diagram type won't be rendered as an image but start throwing error since we don't support parsing the data yet.

## Writing the Diagram Parser

Once the diagram type is added in previous step. Next step is to write the parser to parse the mermaid diagram.

For this create a file named `{{diagramType}}.ts` in [`src/parser`](https://github.com/excalidraw/mermaid-to-excalidraw/tree/master/src/parser) and write a function `parseMermaid{{diagramType}}Diagram` similar to how we [`parseMermaidFlowChartDiagram`](https://github.com/excalidraw/mermaid-to-excalidraw/blob/master/src/parser/flowchart.ts#L256) for parsing flowchart diagram.

The main aim of the parser is :point_down:

1. Determine how elements are connected in the diagram and thus finding arrow and text bindings. 

For this you might have to dig in to the parser `diagram.parser.yy` and which attributes to parse for the new diagram.

2. Determine the position and dimensions of each element, for this would be using the `svg`

Once the parser is ready, lets start using it. 

Add the diagram type in switch case in [`parseMermaid`](https://github.com/excalidraw/mermaid-to-excalidraw/blob/master/src/parseMermaid.ts#L97) and call the parser for the same.

## Writing the Excalidraw Skeleton Convertor

With the completion of previous step, we have all the data, now we need to transform it so to [ExcalidrawElementSkeleton](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/data/transform.ts#L133) format.

Similar to [`FlowChartToExcalidrawSkeletonConverter`](https://github.com/excalidraw/mermaid-to-excalidraw/blob/master/src/converter/types/flowchart.ts#L24), you have to write the `{{diagramType}}ToExcalidrawSkeletonConverter` which parses the data received in previous step and returns the [ExcalidrawElementSkeleton](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/data/transform.ts#L133).

Thats it, you have added the new diagram type ðŸ¥³, now lets test it out!

## Updating the Playground

1. Create a file named `{{diagramType}}.ts` in [`playround/testcases/`](https://github.com/excalidraw/mermaid-to-excalidraw/tree/master/playground/testcases). For reference you can check [`flowchart.ts`](https://github.com/excalidraw/mermaid-to-excalidraw/blob/master/playground/testcases/flowchart.ts).

2. Incase the new diagram type added is present in [`unsupported.ts`](https://github.com/excalidraw/mermaid-to-excalidraw/blob/master/playground/testcases/unsupported.ts) then remove it from there.

3. Verify if the test cases are running fine in playground.
