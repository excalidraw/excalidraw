### Does this package support collaboration ?

No, Excalidraw package doesn't come with collaboration built in, since the implementation is specific to each host app. We expose APIs which you can use to communicate with Excalidraw which you can use to implement it. You can check our own implementation [here](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/excalidraw-app/index.tsx). Here is a [detailed answer](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/discussions/3879#discussioncomment-1110524) on how you can achieve the same.
