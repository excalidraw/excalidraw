# Integration

## Module bundler

If you are using a module bundler (for instance, Webpack), you can import it as an ES6 module as shown below

```js
import { Excalidraw } from "@excalidraw/excalidraw";
```

:::info

Throughout the documentation we use live, editable Excalidraw examples like the one shown below.

While we aim for the examples to closely reflect what you'd get if you rendered it yourself, we actually initialize it with some props behind the scenes.  
For example, we're passing a `theme` prop to it based on the current color theme of the docs you're just reading.

:::

```jsx live
function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1 style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>Excalidraw Example</h1>
      <div style={{ height: "500px" }}>
        <Excalidraw />
      </div>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Next.js

Since Excalidraw doesn't support `server side rendering` so it should be rendered only on `client`. The way to achieve this in next.js is using `next.js dynamic import`.

If you want to only import `Excalidraw` component you can do :point_down:

```jsx showLineNumbers
import dynamic from "next/dynamic";
const Excalidraw = dynamic(
  async () => (await import("@excalidraw/excalidraw")).Excalidraw,
  {
    ssr: false,
  },
);
export default function App() {
  return <Excalidraw />;
}
```

However the above component only works for named component exports. If you want to import some util / constant or something else apart from Excalidraw, then this approach will not work. Instead you can write a wrapper over Excalidraw and import the wrapper dynamically.

If you are using `pages router` then importing the wrapper dynamically would work, where as if you are using `app router` then you will have to also add `useClient` directive on top of the file in addition to dynamically importing the wrapper as shown :point_down:

  "use client";
  import { Excalidraw. convertToExcalidrawElements } from "@excalidraw/excalidraw";

  import "@excalidraw/excalidraw/index.css";

  const ExcalidrawWrapper: React.FC = () => {
    console.info(convertToExcalidrawElements([{
      type: "rectangle",
      id: "rect-1",
      width: 186.47265625,
      height: 141.9765625,
    },]));
    return (
      <div style={{height:"500px", width:"500px"}}  
        <Excalidraw />
      </div> 
    );
  };
  export default ExcalidrawWrapper;
  ```

    async () => (await import("../excalidrawWrapper")).default,
    {
      ssr: false,
    },
  );

  export default function Page() {

Here is a [source code](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/tree/master/examples/excalidraw/with-nextjs) for the example with app and pages router. You you can try it out [here](https://excalidraw-package-example-with-nextjs-gh6smrdnq-excalidraw.vercel.app/).


The `types` are available at `@excalidraw/excalidraw/types`, you can view [example for typescript](https://codesandbox.io/s/excalidraw-types-9h2dm)

### Preact

Since we support `umd` build ships with `react/jsx-runtime` and `react-dom/client` inlined with the package. This conflicts with `Preact` and hence the build doesn't work directly with `Preact`.

However we have shipped a separate build for `Preact` so if you are using `Preact` you need to set `process.env.IS_PREACT` to `true` to use the `Preact` build.

Once the above `env` variable is set, you will be able to use the package in `Preact` as well.

:::info

When using `vite` or any build tools, you will have to make sure the `process` is accessible as we are accessing `process.env.IS_PREACT` to decide whether to use `preact` build.

Since Vite removes env variables by default, you can update the vite config to ensure its available :point_down:

```
 define: {
    "process.env.IS_PREACT": JSON.stringify("true"),
  },
```

## Browser

To use it in a browser directly:

For development use :point_down:

```js
<script
  type="text/javascript"
  src="https://unpkg.com/@excalidraw/excalidraw/dist/excalidraw.development.js"
></script>
```

For production use :point_down:

```js
<script
  type="text/javascript"
  src="https://unpkg.com/@excalidraw/excalidraw/dist/excalidraw.production.min.js"
></script>
```

You will need to make sure `react`, `react-dom` is available as shown in the below example. For prod please use the production versions of `react`, `react-dom`.

import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";
