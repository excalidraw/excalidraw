# Integration

## Module bundler

If you are using a module bundler (for instance, Webpack), you can import it as an ES6 module as shown below

```js
import { Excalidraw } from "@excalidraw/excalidraw";
```

:::info

Throughout the documentation we use live, editable Excalidraw examples like the one shown below.

While we aim for the examples to closely reflect what you'd get if you rendered it yourself, we actually initialize it with some props behind the scenes.  
For example, we're passing a `theme` prop to it based on the current color theme of the docs you're just reading.

:::

```jsx live
function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1 style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>Excalidraw Example</h1>
      <div style={{ height: "500px" }}>
        <Excalidraw />
      </div>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Rendering Excalidraw only on client

Since _Excalidraw_ doesn't support server side rendering, you should render the component once the host is `mounted`.

Here are two ways on how you can render **Excalidraw** on **Next.js**.

1. Importing Excalidraw once **client** is rendered.

```jsx showLineNumbers
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
export default function App() {
  const [Excalidraw, setExcalidraw] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    import("@excalidraw/excalidraw").then((comp) =>
      setExcalidraw(comp.Excalidraw),
    );
  }, []);
  return <>{Excalidraw && <Excalidraw />}</>;
}
```

Here is a working [demo](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/excalidraw-with-next-5xb3d)

2. Using **Next.js Dynamic** import.

Since Excalidraw doesn't server side rendering so you can also use `dynamic import` to render by setting `ssr` to `false`. However one drawback is the `Refs` don't work with dynamic import in Next.js. We are working on overcoming this and have a better API.

```jsx showLineNumbers
import dynamic from "next/dynamic";
const Excalidraw = dynamic(
  async () => (await import("@excalidraw/excalidraw")).Excalidraw,
  {
    ssr: false,
  },
);
export default function App() {
  return <Excalidraw />;
}
```

Here is a working [demo](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/excalidraw-with-next-dynamic-k8yjq2).

The `types` are available at `@excalidraw/excalidraw/types`, you can view [example for typescript](https://codesandbox.io/s/excalidraw-types-9h2dm)

## Browser

To use it in a browser directly:

For development use :point_down:

```js
<script
  type="text/javascript"
  src="https://unpkg.com/@excalidraw/excalidraw/dist/excalidraw.development.js"
></script>
```

For production use :point_down:

```js
<script
  type="text/javascript"
  src="https://unpkg.com/@excalidraw/excalidraw/dist/excalidraw.production.min.js"
></script>
```

You will need to make sure `react`, `react-dom` is available as shown in the below example. For prod please use the production versions of `react`, `react-dom`.

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="html" label="html">
