## Documentation

### Shortcuts

You can almost do anything with shortcuts. Click on the help icon on the bottom right corner to see them all.

### Curved lines and arrows

Choose line or arrow and click click click instead of drag.

### Charts

You can easily create charts by copy pasting data from Excel or just plain comma separated text.

### Translating

To translate Excalidraw into other languages, please visit [our Crowdin page](https://crowdin.com/project/excalidraw). To add a new language, [open an issue](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/new) so we can get things set up on our end first.

Translations will be available on the app if they exceed a certain threshold of completion (currently 85%).

### Create a collaboration session manually

In order to create a session manually, you just need to generate a link of this form:

```
https://excalidraw.com/#room=[0-9a-f]{20},[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{22}
```

#### Example

```
https://excalidraw.com/#room=91bd46ae3aa84dff9d20,pfLqgEoY1c2ioq8LmGwsFA
```

The first set of digits is the room. This is visible from the server that’s going to dispatch messages to everyone that knows this number.

The second set of digits is the encryption key. The Excalidraw server doesn’t know about it. This is what all the participants use to encrypt/decrypt the messages.

#### Docker Compose

You can use docker-compose to work on Excalidraw locally if you don't want to setup a Node.js env.

```sh
docker-compose up --build -d
```

### Self-hosting

We publish a Docker image with the Excalidraw client at [excalidraw/excalidraw](https://hub.docker.com/r/excalidraw/excalidraw). You can use it to self-host your own client under your own domain, on Kubernetes, AWS ECS, etc.

```sh
docker build -t excalidraw/excalidraw .
docker run --rm -dit --name excalidraw -p 5000:80 excalidraw/excalidraw:latest
```

The Docker image is free of analytics and other tracking libraries.

**At the moment, self-hosting your own instance doesn't support sharing or collaboration features.**

We are working towards providing a full-fledged solution for self-hosting your own Excalidraw.
