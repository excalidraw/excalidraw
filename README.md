## Excalidraw.com

The app hosted at [excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com) is a minimal showcase of what you can build with Excalidraw. Its [source code](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/tree/master/excalidraw-app) is part of this repository as well, and the app features:

- 📡&nbsp;PWA support (works offline).
- 🤼&nbsp;Real-time collaboration.
- 🔒&nbsp;End-to-end encryption.
- 💾&nbsp;Local-first support (autosaves to the browser).
- 🔗&nbsp;Shareable links (export to a readonly link you can share with others).

We'll be adding these features as drop-in plugins for the npm package in the future.

## Quick start

**Note:** following instructions are for installing the Excalidraw [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@excalidraw/excalidraw) when integrating Excalidraw into your own app. To run the repository locally for development, please refer to our [Development Guide](https://docs.excalidraw.com/docs/introduction/development).

Use `npm` or `yarn` to install the package.

```bash
npm install react react-dom @excalidraw/excalidraw
# or
yarn add react react-dom @excalidraw/excalidraw
```

Check out our [documentation](https://docs.excalidraw.com/docs/@excalidraw/excalidraw/installation) for more details!

## Firebase Setup for Collaboration

This project uses Firebase for real-time collaboration and to save whiteboards. To use your own Firebase project, follow these steps:

### 1. Firestore Security Rules

The project requires specific security rules to allow users to read and write data securely.

-   Find the `firestore.rules` file in the root of this project.
-   Go to your [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
-   Select your project.
-   Navigate to **Build > Firestore Database**.
-   Click on the **Rules** tab.
-   Copy the content from the `firestore.rules` file and paste it into the editor, replacing the existing rules.
-   Click **Publish**.

### 2. Environment Variables

The application needs your Firebase project's configuration to connect to the service.

-   In the `excalidraw-app` directory, you will find a file named `.env.example`.
-   Create a copy of this file and rename it to `.env`.
-   Open the `.env` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase project configuration. You can find this configuration in your Firebase project settings under "Your apps" > "Web app".
-   **Important**: The `.env` file should not be committed to version control. It is already included in the `.gitignore` file.

For deployment (e.g., on Vercel), you will need to set the `VITE_APP_FIREBASE_CONFIG` environment variable in your deployment provider's settings, using the same JSON configuration.
