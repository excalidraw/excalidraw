## Overview

This is a modified version of Excalidraw that includes a powerful **AI Chatbot Assistant** to help you create diagrams, flowcharts, and shapes using natural language. Simply describe what you want to create, and the AI will generate it on the canvas for you!

> **⭐ Built on top of the amazing [Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw) project!**
> 
> This repository is a fork of the original [Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw) by the Excalidraw team. All the core features, whiteboard functionality, and collaboration capabilities are from the original project. I've only added the AI Chatbot Assistant feature on top of it.

- Chat history is saved automatically, but you can clear it anytime
- Switch between AI models to find the one that works best for you

## 📝 Notes

- The chatbot requires an active internet connection

- Different models may produce different results - experiment to find what works best
- The AI is designed specifically for Excalidraw and understands its element types and styling
