# Build and Test

**Purpose**: Build all units and execute comprehensive testing strategy

## Prerequisites

\`\`\`bash
[Commands to start services]
# Example: docker-compose up, start test database
\`\`\`

### 2. Configure Service Endpoints
\`\`\`bash

# Example: export API_URL=http://localhost:8080
\`\`\`

## Run Integration Tests

## Step 5: Generate Performance Test Instructions (If Applicable)

Create `aidlc-docs/construction/performance-test-instructions.md`:

```markdown
# Performance Test Instructions

## Purpose
Validate system performance under load to ensure it meets requirements.

## Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: < [X]ms for [Y]% of requests
- **Throughput**: [X] requests/second
- **Concurrent Users**: Support [X] concurrent users
- **Error Rate**: < [X]%

## Setup Performance Test Environment

### 1. Prepare Test Environment
\`\`\`bash
[Commands to set up performance testing]
# Example: scale services, configure load balancers
\`\`\`

### 2. Configure Test Parameters
- **Test Duration**: [X] minutes
- **Ramp-up Time**: [X] seconds
- **Virtual Users**: [X] users

## Run Performance Tests

### 1. Execute Load Tests
\`\`\`bash
[Command to run load tests]
# Example: jmeter -n -t test.jmx, k6 run script.js
\`\`\`

### 2. Execute Stress Tests
\`\`\`bash
[Command to run stress tests]
# Example: gradually increase load until failure
\`\`\`

### 3. Analyze Performance Results
- **Response Time**: [Actual vs Expected]
- **Throughput**: [Actual vs Expected]
- **Error Rate**: [Actual vs Expected]
- **Bottlenecks**: [Identified bottlenecks]
- **Results Location**: [Path to performance reports]

## Performance Optimization

If performance doesn't meet requirements:
