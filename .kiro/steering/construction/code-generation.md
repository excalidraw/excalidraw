# Code Generation - Detailed Steps

## Overview
This stage generates code for each unit of work through two integrated parts:
- **Part 1 - Planning**: Create detailed code generation plan with explicit steps
- **Part 2 - Generation**: Execute approved plan to generate code, tests, and artifacts

## Prerequisites
- Unit Design Generation must be complete for the unit
- NFR Implementation (if executed) must be complete for the unit
- All unit design artifacts must be available
- Unit is ready for code generation

---

# PART 1: PLANNING

## Step 1: Analyze Unit Context
- [ ] Read unit design artifacts from Unit Design Generation
- [ ] Read unit story map to understand assigned stories
- [ ] Identify unit dependencies and interfaces
- [ ] Validate unit is ready for code generation

## Step 2: Create Detailed Unit Code Generation Plan
- [ ] Create explicit steps for unit generation:
  - Business Logic Generation
  - Business Logic Unit Testing
  - Business Logic Summary
  - API Layer Generation
  - API Layer Unit Testing
  - API Layer Summary
  - Repository Layer Generation
  - Repository Layer Unit Testing
  - Repository Layer Summary
  - Database Migration Scripts Generation (if data models exist)
  - Documentation Generation (API docs, README updates)
  - Deployment Artifacts Generation
- [ ] Number each step sequentially
- [ ] Include story mapping references for this unit
- [ ] Add checkboxes [ ] for each step

## Step 3: Include Unit Generation Context
- [ ] For this unit, include:
  - Stories implemented by this unit
  - Dependencies on other units/services
  - Expected interfaces and contracts
  - Database entities owned by this unit
  - Service boundaries and responsibilities

## Step 4: Create Unit Plan Document
- [ ] Save complete plan as `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/{unit-name}-code-generation-plan.md`
- [ ] Include step numbering (Step 1, Step 2, etc.)
- [ ] Include unit context and dependencies
- [ ] Include story traceability
- [ ] Ensure plan is executable step-by-step
- [ ] Emphasize that this plan is the single source of truth for Code Generation

## Step 5: Summarize Unit Plan
- [ ] Provide summary of the unit code generation plan to the user
- [ ] Highlight unit generation approach
- [ ] Explain step sequence and story coverage
- [ ] Note total number of steps and estimated scope

## Step 6: Log Approval Prompt
- [ ] Before asking for approval, log the prompt with timestamp in `aidlc-docs/audit.md`
- [ ] Include reference to the complete unit code generation plan
- [ ] Use ISO 8601 timestamp format

## Step 7: Wait for Explicit Approval
- [ ] Do not proceed until the user explicitly approves the unit code generation plan
- [ ] Approval must cover the entire plan and generation sequence
- [ ] If user requests changes, update the plan and repeat approval process

## Step 8: Record Approval Response
- [ ] Log the user's approval response with timestamp in `aidlc-docs/audit.md`
- [ ] Include the exact user response text
- [ ] Mark the approval status clearly

## Step 9: Update Progress
- [ ] Mark Code Planning complete in `aidlc-state.md`
- [ ] Update the "Current Status" section
- [ ] Prepare for transition to Code Generation

# PART 2: GENERATION

## Step 10: Load Unit Code Generation Plan
- [ ] Read the complete plan from `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/{unit-name}-code-generation-plan.md`
- [ ] Identify the next uncompleted step (first [ ] checkbox)
- [ ] Load the context for that step (unit, dependencies, stories)

## Step 11: Execute Current Step
- [ ] Perform exactly what the current step describes
- [ ] Generate code, tests, or documentation as specified
- [ ] Follow the unit's story requirements
- [ ] Respect dependencies and interfaces defined in the plan

## Step 12: Update Progress
- [ ] Mark the completed step as [x] in the unit code generation plan
- [ ] Mark associated unit stories as [x] when their generation is finished
- [ ] Update `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` current status
- [ ] Save all generated artifacts

## Step 13: Continue or Complete
- [ ] If more steps remain, return to Step 10
- [ ] If all steps complete, mark Code Generation stage as complete for this unit
- [ ] Provide final summary of unit generation

## Critical Rules

### Planning Phase Rules
- Create explicit, numbered steps for all generation activities
- Include story traceability in the plan
- Document unit context and dependencies
- Get explicit user approval before generation

### Generation Phase Rules
- **NO HARDCODED LOGIC**: Only execute what's written in the unit plan
- **FOLLOW PLAN EXACTLY**: Do not deviate from the step sequence
- **UPDATE CHECKBOXES**: Mark [x] immediately after completing each step
- **STORY TRACEABILITY**: Mark unit stories [x] when functionality is implemented
- **RESPECT DEPENDENCIES**: Only implement when unit dependencies are satisfied

## Completion Criteria
- Complete unit code generation plan created and approved
- All steps in unit code generation plan marked [x]
- All unit stories implemented according to plan
- All code and tests generated (tests will be executed in Build & Test phase)
- Deployment artifacts generated
- Complete service/module ready for build and verification
