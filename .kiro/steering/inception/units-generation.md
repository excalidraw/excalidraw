# Units Generation - Detailed Steps

## Overview
This stage decomposes the system into manageable units of work through two integrated parts:
- **Part 1 - Planning**: Create decomposition plan with questions, collect answers, analyze for ambiguities, get approval
- **Part 2 - Generation**: Execute approved plan to generate unit artifacts

**DEFINITION**: A unit of work is a logical grouping of stories for development purposes. For microservices, each unit becomes an independently deployable service. For monoliths, the single unit represents the entire application with logical modules.

**Terminology**: Use "Service" for independently deployable components, "Module" for logical groupings within a service, "Unit of Work" for planning context.

## Prerequisites
- Context Assessment must be complete
- Requirements Assessment recommended (provides functional scope)
- Story Development recommended (stories map to units)
- Application Design phase REQUIRED (determines components, methods, and services)
- Execution plan must indicate Design phase should execute

# PART 1: PLANNING

## Step 1: Create Unit of Work Plan
- Generate plan with checkboxes [] for decomposing system into units of work
- Focus on breaking down the system into manageable development units
- Each step and sub-step should have a checkbox []

## Step 2: Include Mandatory Unit Artifacts in Plan
**ALWAYS** include these mandatory artifacts in the unit plan:
- [ ] Generate `aidlc-docs/inception/application-design/unit-of-work.md` with unit definitions and responsibilities
- [ ] Generate `aidlc-docs/inception/application-design/unit-of-work-dependency.md` with dependency matrix
- [ ] Generate `aidlc-docs/inception/application-design/unit-of-work-story-map.md` mapping stories to units
- [ ] Validate unit boundaries and dependencies
- [ ] Ensure all stories are assigned to units

## Step 3: Generate Context-Appropriate Questions
**DIRECTIVE**: Analyze the requirements, stories, and application design to generate ONLY questions relevant to THIS specific decomposition problem. Use the categories below as inspiration, NOT as a mandatory checklist. Skip entire categories if not applicable.

- EMBED questions using [Answer]: tag format
- Focus on ambiguities and missing information specific to this context
- Generate questions only where user input is needed for decision-making

**Example question categories** (adapt as needed):
- **Story Grouping** - Only if multiple stories exist and grouping strategy is unclear
- **Dependencies** - Only if multiple units likely and integration approach is ambiguous
- **Team Alignment** - Only if team structure or ownership is unclear
- **Technical Considerations** - Only if scalability/deployment requirements differ across units
- **Business Domain** - Only if domain boundaries or bounded contexts are unclear

## Step 4: Store UOW Plan
- Save as `aidlc-docs/inception/plans/unit-of-work-plan.md`
- Include all [Answer]: tags for user input
- Ensure plan covers all aspects of system decomposition

## Step 5: Request User Input
- Ask user to fill [Answer]: tags directly in the plan document
- Emphasize importance of decomposition decisions
- Provide clear instructions on completing the [Answer]: tags

## Step 6: Collect Answers
- Wait for user to provide answers to all questions using [Answer]: tags in the document
- Do not proceed until ALL [Answer]: tags are completed
- Review the document to ensure no [Answer]: tags are left blank

## Step 7: ANALYZE ANSWERS (MANDATORY)
Before proceeding, you MUST carefully review all user answers for:
- **Vague or ambiguous responses**: "mix of", "somewhere between", "not sure", "depends"
- **Undefined criteria or terms**: References to concepts without clear definitions
- **Contradictory answers**: Responses that conflict with each other
- **Missing generation details**: Answers that lack specific guidance
- **Answers that combine options**: Responses that merge different approaches without clear decision rules

## Step 8: MANDATORY Follow-up Questions
If the analysis in step 7 reveals ANY ambiguous answers, you MUST:
- Add specific follow-up questions to the plan document using [Answer]: tags
- DO NOT proceed to approval until all ambiguities are resolved
- Examples of required follow-ups:
  - "You mentioned 'mix of A and B' - what specific criteria should determine when to use A vs B?"
  - "You said 'somewhere between A and B' - can you define the exact middle ground approach?"
  - "You indicated 'not sure' - what additional information would help you decide?"
  - "You mentioned 'depends on complexity' - how do you define complexity levels?"

## Step 9: Request Approval
- Ask: "**Unit of work plan complete. Review the plan in aidlc-docs/inception/plans/unit-of-work-plan.md. Ready to proceed to generation?**"
- DO NOT PROCEED until user confirms

## Step 10: Log Approval
- Log prompt and response in audit.md with timestamp
- Use ISO 8601 timestamp format
- Include complete approval prompt text

## Step 11: Update Progress
- Mark Units Planning complete in aidlc-state.md
- Update the "Current Status" section
- Prepare for transition to Units Generation

---

# PART 2: GENERATION

## Step 12: Load Unit of Work Plan
- [ ] Read the complete plan from `aidlc-docs/inception/plans/unit-of-work-plan.md`
- [ ] Identify the next uncompleted step (first [ ] checkbox)
- [ ] Load the context and requirements for that step

## Step 13: Execute Current Step
- [ ] Perform exactly what the current step describes
- [ ] Generate unit artifacts as specified in the plan
- [ ] Follow the approved decomposition approach from Planning
- [ ] Use the criteria and boundaries specified in the plan

## Step 14: Update Progress
- [ ] Mark the completed step as [x] in the unit of work plan
- [ ] Update `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` current status
- [ ] Save all generated artifacts

## Step 15: Continue or Complete
- [ ] If more steps remain, return to Step 12
- [ ] If all steps complete, verify units are ready for design stages
- [ ] Mark Units Generation stage as complete

## Critical Rules

### Planning Phase Rules
- Generate ONLY context-relevant questions
- Use [Answer]: tag format for all questions
- Analyze all answers for ambiguities before proceeding
- Resolve ALL ambiguities with follow-up questions
- Get explicit user approval before generation

### Generation Phase Rules
- **NO HARDCODED LOGIC**: Only execute what's written in the unit of work plan
- **FOLLOW PLAN EXACTLY**: Do not deviate from the step sequence
- **UPDATE CHECKBOXES**: Mark [x] immediately after completing each step
- **USE APPROVED APPROACH**: Follow the decomposition methodology from Planning
- **VERIFY COMPLETION**: Ensure all unit artifacts are complete before proceeding

## Completion Criteria
- All planning questions answered and ambiguities resolved
- User approval obtained for the plan
- All steps in unit of work plan marked [x]
- All unit artifacts generated according to plan:
  - `unit-of-work.md` with unit definitions
  - `unit-of-work-dependency.md` with dependency matrix
  - `unit-of-work-story-map.md` with story mappings
- Units verified and ready for per-unit design stages
