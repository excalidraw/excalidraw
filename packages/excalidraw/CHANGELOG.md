### Breaking changes

#### Deprecated UMD bundle in favor of ES modules [#7441](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/7441), [#9127](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/9127)

We've transitioned from `UMD` to `ESM` bundle format. Our new `dist` bundles inside `@excalidraw/excalidraw` package now contain only bundled source files, making any dependencies tree-shakable. The npm package comes with the following structure:

> **Note**: The structure is simplified for the sake of brevity, omitting lazy-loadable modules, including locales (previously treated as json assets) and source maps in the development bundle.

```
@excalidraw/excalidraw/
├── dist/
│   ├── dev/
│   │   ├── fonts/
│   │   ├── index.css
│   │   ├── index.js
│   │   ├── index.js.map
│   ├── prod/
│   │   ├── fonts/
│   │   ├── index.css
│   │   ├── index.js
│   └── types/
```

##### JavaScript: required `"type": "module"` in package.json

Make sure that your JavaScript environment supports ES modules, as it might be required to define `"type": "module"` in your `package.json` file or as part of the `<script type="module" />` attribute.

##### Typescript: deprecated "moduleResolution": `"node"` or `"node10"`

Since `"node"` and `"node10"` do not support `package.json` `"exports"` fields, having these values in your `tsconfig.json` will not work. Instead, use `"bundler"`, `"node16"` or `"nodenext"` values. For more information, see [Typescript's documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#moduleResolution).

##### New structure of the imports

Dependening on the environment, this is how imports should look like with the `ESM`:

**With bundler (Vite, Next.js, etc.)**

```ts
// excalidraw library with public API
import * as excalidrawLib from "@excalidraw/excalidraw";
// excalidraw react component
import { Excalidraw } from "@excalidraw/excalidraw";
// excalidraw styles, usually auto-processed by the build tool (i.e. vite, next, etc.)
import "@excalidraw/excalidraw/index.css";
// excalidraw types (optional)
import type { ExcalidrawImperativeAPI } from "@excalidraw/excalidraw/types";
```

**Without bundler (Browser)**

```html
<!-- Environment: browser with a script tag and no bundler -->

<!-- excalidraw styles -->
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://esm.sh/@excalidraw/excalidraw@0.18.0/dist/dev/index.css"
/>
<!-- import maps used for deduplicating react & react-dom versions -->
<script type="importmap">
  {
    "imports": {
      "react": "https://esm.sh/react@19.0.0",
      "react/jsx-runtime": "https://esm.sh/react@19.0.0/jsx-runtime",
      "react-dom": "https://esm.sh/react-dom@19.0.0"
    }
  }
</script>
<script type="module">
  import React from "https://esm.sh/react@19.0.0";
  import ReactDOM from "https://esm.sh/react-dom@19.0.0";
  import * as ExcalidrawLib from "https://esm.sh/@excalidraw/excalidraw@0.18.0/dist/dev/index.js?external=react,react-dom";
</script>
```

#### Deprecated `excalidraw-assets` and `excalidraw-assets-dev` folders [#8012](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/8012), [#9127](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/9127)

The `excalidraw-assets` and `excalidraw-assets-dev` folders, which contained locales and fonts, are no longer used and have been deprecated.

##### Locales

Locales are no longer treated as static `.json` assets, but are transpiled with `esbuild` dirrectly to the `.js` as ES modules. Note that some build tools (i.e. Vite) may require setting `es2022` as a build target, in order to support "Arbitrary module namespace identifier names", e.g. `export { english as "en-us" } )`.

```js
// vite.config.js
optimizeDeps: {
  esbuildOptions: {
    // Bumping to 2022 due to "Arbitrary module namespace identifier names" not being
    // supported in Vite's default browser target https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/13556
    target: "es2022",
    // Tree shaking is optional, but recommended
    treeShaking: true,
  },
}
```

##### Fonts

New fonts, which we've added, are automatically loaded from the CDN. For self-hosting purposes, you'll have to copy the content of the folder `node_modules/@excalidraw/excalidraw/dist/prod/fonts` to the path where your assets should be served from (i.e. `public/` directory in your project). In that case, you should also set `window.EXCALIDRAW_ASSET_PATH` to the very same path, i.e. `/` in case it's in the root:

```js
<script>window.EXCALIDRAW_ASSET_PATH = "/";</script>
```

or, if you serve your assets from the root of your CDN, you would do:

```js
<script>
  window.EXCALIDRAW_ASSET_PATH = "https://cdn.domain.com/subpath/";
</script>
```

or, if you prefer the path to be dynamicly set based on the `location.origin`, you could do the following:

```jsx
// Next.js
<Script id="load-env-variables" strategy="beforeInteractive">
  {`window["EXCALIDRAW_ASSET_PATH"] = location.origin;`} // or use just "/"!
</Script>
```

#### Deprecated `commitToHistory` in favor of `captureUpdate` in `updateScene` API [#7348](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/7348), [#7898](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull//7898)

```js
// before
updateScene({ elements, appState, commitToHistory: true }); // A
updateScene({ elements, appState, commitToHistory: false }); // B

// after
import { CaptureUpdateAction } from "@excalidraw/excalidraw";
updateScene({
  elements,
  appState,
  captureUpdate: CaptureUpdateAction.IMMEDIATELY,
}); // A
updateScene({
  elements,
  appState,
  captureUpdate: CaptureUpdateAction.NEVER,
}); // B
```

The `updateScene` API has changed due to the added `Store` component, as part of multiplayer undo / redo initiative. Specifically, optional `sceneData` parameter `commitToHistory: boolean` was replaced with optional `captureUpdate: CaptureUpdateActionType` parameter. Therefore, make sure to update all instances of `updateScene`, which use `commitToHistory` parameter according to the _before / after_ table below.

> **Note**: Some updates are not observed by the store / history - i.e. updates to `collaborators` object or parts of `AppState` which are not observed (not `ObservedAppState`). Such updates will never make it to the undo / redo stacks, regardless of the passed `captureUpdate` value.

| Undo behaviour | `commitToHistory` (before) | `captureUpdate` (after) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _Immediately undoable_ | `true` | `CaptureUpdateAction.IMMEDIATELY` | Use for updates which should be captured. Should be used for most of the local updates. These updates will _immediately_ make it to the local undo / redo stacks. |
| _Eventually undoable_ | `false` (default) | `CaptureUpdateAction.EVENTUALLY` (default) | Use for updates which should not be captured immediately - likely exceptions which are part of some async multi-step process. Otherwise, all such updates would end up being captured with the next `CaptureUpdateAction.IMMEDIATELY` - triggered either by the next `updateScene` or internally by the editor. These updates will _eventually_ make it to the local undo / redo stacks. |
| _Never undoable_ | n/a | `CaptureUpdateAction.NEVER` | **NEW**: Previously there was no equivalent for this value. Now, it's recommended to use `CaptureUpdateAction.NEVER` for updates which should never be recorded, such as remote updates or scene initialization. These updates will _never_ make it to the local undo / redo stacks. |

#### Other

- `ExcalidrawTextElement.baseline` was removed and replaced with a vertical offset computation based on font metrics, performed on each text element re-render. In case of custom font usage, extend the `FONT_METRICS` object with the related properties. [#7693](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/7693)

- `ExcalidrawEmbeddableElement.validated` was removed and moved to private editor state. This should largely not affect your apps unless you were reading from this attribute. We keep validating embeddable urls internally, and the public [`props.validateEmbeddable`](https://docs.excalidraw.com/docs/@excalidraw/excalidraw/api/props#validateembeddable) still applies. [#7539](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/7539)

- Stats container CSS has changed, so if you're using `renderCustomStats`, you may need to adjust your styles to retain the same layout. [#8361](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/8361)

- `<DefaultSidebar />` triggers are now always merged with host app triggers, rendered through `<DefaultSidebar.Triggers/>`. `<DefaultSidebar.Triggers/>` no longer accepts any props other than children. [#8498](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/8498)

### Features

- `MainMenu.DefaultItems.ToggleTheme` now supports `onSelect(theme: string)` callback, and optionally `allowSystemTheme: boolean` alongside `theme: string` to indicate you want to allow users to set to system theme (you need to handle this yourself) [#7853](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/7853)

## 0.17.3 (2024-02-09)

### Fixes

- Keep customData when converting to ExcalidrawElement. [#7656](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/7656)

- Umd build for browser since it was breaking in v0.17.0 [#7349](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/7349). Also make sure that when using `Vite`, the `process.env.IS_PREACT` is set as `"true"` (string) and not a boolean.

```
define: {
  "process.env.IS_PREACT": JSON.stringify("true"),
}
```

- Disable caching bounds for arrow labels [#7343](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/7343)

## Excalidraw Library

### Fixes

- Disable caching bounds for arrow labels [#7343](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/7343)

## 0.17.0 (2023-11-14)

### Features

- Added support for disabling `image` tool (also disabling image insertion in general, though keeps support for importing from `.excalidraw` files) [#6320](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/6320).

  For disabling `image` you need to set 👇

  ```
  UIOptions.tools = {
    image: false
  }
  ```

- Support `excalidrawAPI` prop for accessing the Excalidraw API [#7251](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/7251).

- Export [`getCommonBounds`](https://docs.excalidraw.com/docs/@excalidraw/excalidraw/api/utils#getcommonbounds) helper from the package [#7247](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/7247).

- Support frames via programmatic API [#7205](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/7205).

- Export `elementsOverlappingBBox`, `isElementInsideBBox`, `elementPartiallyOverlapsWithOrContainsBBox` helpers for filtering/checking if elements within bounds. [#6727](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/6727)

- Regenerate ids by default when using transform api and also update bindings by 0.5px to avoid possible overlapping [#7195](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/7195)

- Add onChange, onPointerDown, onPointerUp api subscribers [#7154](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/7154).

- Support props.locked for setActiveTool [#7153](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/7153).

- Add `selected` prop for `MainMenu.Item` and `MainMenu.ItemCustom` components to indicate active state. [#7078](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/7078)

### Fixes

- Double image dialog on image insertion [#7152](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/7152).

### Breaking Changes

- The `Ref` support has been removed in v0.17.0 so if you are using refs, please update the integration to use the [`excalidrawAPI`](http://localhost:3003/docs/@excalidraw/excalidraw/api/props/excalidraw-api) [#7251](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/7251).

- Additionally `ready` and `readyPromise` from the API have been discontinued. These APIs were found to be superfluous, and as part of the effort to streamline the APIs and maintain simplicity, they were removed in version v0.17.0 [#7251](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/7251).

- [`useDevice`](https://docs.excalidraw.com/docs/@excalidraw/excalidraw/api/utils#usedevice) hook's return value was changed to differentiate between `editor` and `viewport` breakpoints. [#7243](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/7243)

### Build

- Support Preact [#7255](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/7255). The host needs to set `process.env.IS_PREACT` to `true`

  When using `vite` or any build tools, you will have to make sure the `process` is accessible as we are accessing `process.env.IS_PREACT` to decide whether to use the `preact` build.

  Since `Vite` removes env variables by default, you can update the Vite config to ensure its available :point_down:

  ```
  define: {
    "process.env.IS_PREACT": process.env.IS_PREACT,
  },
  ```

## 0.16.1 (2023-09-21)

## Excalidraw Library

**_This section lists the updates made to the excalidraw library and will not affect the integration._**

### Fixes

- More eye-droper fixes [#7019](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/7019)

### Refactor

- Move excalidraw-app outside src [#6987](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/6987)

---

## 0.16.0 (2023-09-19)

- Support creating containers, linear elements, text containers, labelled arrows and arrow bindings programatically [#6546](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/6546)
- Introducing Web-Embeds (alias iframe element)[#6691](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/6691)
- Added [`props.validateEmbeddable`](https://docs.excalidraw.com/docs/@excalidraw/excalidraw/api/props#validateembeddable) to customize embeddable src url validation. [#6691](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/6691)
- Add support for `opts.fitToViewport` and `opts.viewportZoomFactor` in the [`ExcalidrawAPI.scrollToContent`](https://docs.excalidraw.com/docs/@excalidraw/excalidraw/api/props/excalidraw-api#scrolltocontent) API. [#6581](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/6581).
- Properly sanitize element `link` urls. [#6728](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/6728).
- Sidebar component now supports tabs — for more detailed description of new behavior and breaking changes, see the linked PR. [#6213](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/6213)
- Exposed `DefaultSidebar` component to allow modifying the default sidebar, such as adding custom tabs to it. [#6213](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/6213)

  #### BREAKING CHANGES

  - `props.renderSidebar` is removed in favor of rendering as `children`.
  - `appState.isSidebarDocked` replaced with `appState.defaultSidebarDockedPreference` with slightly different semantics, and relating only to the default sidebar. You need to handle `docked` state for your custom sidebars yourself.
  - Sidebar `props.dockable` is removed. To indicate dockability, supply `props.onDock()` alongside setting `props.docked`.
  - `Sidebar.Header` is no longer rendered by default. You need to render it yourself.
  - `props.onClose` replaced with `props.onStateChange`.
  - `restore()`/`restoreAppState()` now retains `appState.openSidebar` regardless of docked state.

## 0.14.2 (2023-02-01)

## 0.14.1 (2023-01-16)

### Fixes

- remove overflow hidden from button [#6110](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/6110). This fixes the collaborator count css in the [LiveCollaborationTrigger](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#LiveCollaborationTrigger) component.

## 0.14.0 (2023-01-13)

### Features

- Support customization for the editor [welcome screen](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#WelcomeScreen) [#6048](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/6048).

- Expose component API for the Excalidraw main menu [#6034](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/6034), You can read more about its usage [here](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#MainMenu)

- Support customization for the Excalidraw [main menu](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#MainMenu) [#6034](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/6034).

- [Footer](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#Footer) is now rendered as child component instead of passed as a render prop [#5970](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/5970).

- Any top-level children passed to the `<Excalidraw/>` component that do not belong to one of the officially supported Excalidraw children components are now rendered directly inside the Excalidraw container (previously, they weren't rendered at all) [#6096](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/6096).

- Expose [LiveCollaborationTrigger](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#LiveCollaborationTrigger) component. Replaces `props.onCollabButtonClick` [#6104](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/6104).

#### BREAKING CHANGES

- `props.onCollabButtonClick` is now removed. You need to render the main menu item yourself, and optionally also render the `<LiveCollaborationTrigger>` component using [renderTopRightUI](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#renderTopRightUI) prop if you want to retain the canvas button at top-right.
- The prop `renderFooter` is now removed in favor of rendering as a child component.

### Excalidraw schema

- Merged `appState.currentItemStrokeSharpness` and `appState.currentItemLinearStrokeSharpness` into `appState.currentItemRoundness`. Renamed `changeSharpness` action to `changeRoundness`. Excalidraw element's `strokeSharpness` was changed to `roundness`. Check the PR for types and more details [#5553](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/5553).

## 0.13.0 (2022-10-27)

### Excalidraw API

#### Features

- `restoreElements()` now takes an optional parameter to indicate whether we should also recalculate text element dimensions. Defaults to `true`, but since this is a potentially costly operation, you may want to disable it if you restore elements in tight loops, such as during collaboration [#5432](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/5432).
- Support rendering custom sidebar using [`renderSidebar`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#renderSidebar) prop ([#5663](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/5663)).
- Add [`toggleMenu`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#toggleMenu) prop to toggle specific menu open/close state ([#5663](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/5663)).
- Support [theme](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#theme) to be semi-controlled [#5660](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/5660).
- Added support for storing [`customData`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#storing-custom-data-on-excalidraw-elements) on Excalidraw elements [#5592].
- Added `exportPadding?: number;` to [exportToCanvas](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#exporttocanvas) and [exportToBlob](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#exporttoblob). The default value of the padding is `10`.

#### Breaking Changes

- `props.UIOptions.canvasActions.theme` is now renamed to `props.UIOptions.canvasActions.toggleTheme` [#5660](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/5660).
- `setToastMessage` API is now renamed to `setToast` API and the function signature is also updated [#5427](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/5427). You can also pass `duration` and `closable` attributes along with `message`.

Check out the [release notes](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/releases/tag/v0.9.0)

## 0.8.0 (2021-05-15)

## Excalidraw API

**_These section lists the updates which may affect your integration, so it is recommended to go through this when upgrading the version._**

### Features

- Support updating any `appState` properties in [`updateScene`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/components/App.tsx#L282) API. Earlier only `appState.viewBackgroundColor` was supported, now any attribute can be updated with this API.
- Expose [`serializeAsJSON`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#serializeAsJSON) helper that we use when saving Excalidraw scene to a file [#3538](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3538).
- Add support to render custom UI in the top right corner via [`renderTopRightUI`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#renderTopRightUI) prop [#3539](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3539), [#3572](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3572) .

  This also removes the GitHub icon, keeping it local to the https://excalidraw.com app.

### Fixes

- The encryption shield icon is now removed from excalidraw package as it was specific to excalidraw app and is now rendered via [`renderFooter`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#renderFooter) prop. In case you were hiding this icon earlier, you need not do that anymore [#3577](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3577).

  Now `appState` is also passed to [`renderFooter`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#renderFooter) prop.

## Excalidraw Library

**_These section lists the updates made to the excalidraw library and will not affect the integration._**

### Features

- Shortcut key for nerd stats [#3552](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3552).
- Better rendering of curved rectangles [#3562](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3562).
- Improved freedraw [#3512](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3512).
- Add shortcut for dark mode [#3543](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3543).
- Adds rounded icons, joins and caps.[#3521](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3521).

### Fixes

- Exporting freedraw with color to svg [#3565](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3565).
- Handle render errors [#3557](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3557).
- Restore on paste or lib import [#3558](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3558).
- Improve mobile user experience [#3508](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3508).
- Prevent selecting `.visually-hidden` elements [#3501](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3501).

### Perf

- Reduce SVG export size by more than half by reducing precision to 2 decimal places [#3567](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3567).
- Remove `backdrop-filter` to improve perf [#3506](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3506)

## 0.7.0 (2021-04-26)

## Excalidraw API

### Features

- [`scrollToContent`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/components/App.tsx#L265) API now supports passing just a single Excalidraw element, or none at all (which will default to current elements on the scene) [#3482](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3482).

  #### BREAKING CHANGE

  - Renamed `setScrollToContent` to [`scrollToContent`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/components/App.tsx#L265).

- Make library local to given excalidraw instance (previously, all instances on the same page shared one global library) [#3451](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3451).

  - Added prop [onLibraryChange](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#onLibraryChange) which if supplied will be called when library is updated.

  - Added attribute `libraryItems` to prop [initialData](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#initialdata) which can be used to load excalidraw with existing library items.

  - Assign a [unique id](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#Id) to the excalidraw component. The id can be accessed via [`ref`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/components/App.tsx#L298).

  #### BREAKING CHANGE

  - From now on the host application is responsible for [persisting the library](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#onLibraryChange) to LocalStorage (or elsewhere), and [importing it on mount](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#initialdata).

- Bind the keyboard events to component and added a prop [`handleKeyboardGlobally`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#handleKeyboardGlobally) which if set to true will bind the keyboard events to document [#3430](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3430).

  #### BREAKING CHANGE

  - Earlier keyboard events were bind to document but now its bind to Excalidraw component by default. So you will need to set [`handleKeyboardGlobally`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#handleKeyboardGlobally) to true if you want the previous behaviour (bind the keyboard events to document).

- Recompute offsets on `scroll` of the nearest scrollable container [#3408](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3408). This can be disabled by setting [`detectScroll`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#detectScroll) to `false`.

- Add `onPaste` prop to handle custom clipboard behaviours [#3420](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3420).

### Fixes

- Changing z-index of elements (sorting them below/above other elements) now updates their `version` and `versionNonce` (only applies to the selected elements). This fix will allow you account for z-index changes if you're syncing just the elements that changed (and not the whole scene) [#3483](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3483).
- Only handle cut/paste events inside excalidraw [#3484](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3484).

- Make history local to a given Excalidraw instance. This fixes a case where history was getting shared when you have multiple Excalidraw components on the same page [#3481](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3481).
- Use active Excalidraw component when editing text. This fixes a case where text editing was not working when you have multiple Excalidraw components on the same page [#3478](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3478).

- Fix library being pasted off-center [#3462](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3462).

- When switching theme, apply it only to the active Excalidraw component. This fixes a case where the theme was getting applied to the first Excalidraw component if you had multiple Excalidraw components on the same page [#3446](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3446).

### Refactor

- #### BREAKING CHANGE

  - Removed exposing `getSyncableElements` helper which was specific to excalidraw app collab implementation [#3471](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3471). If you happened to use it, you can easily reimplement it yourself using the newly exposed [isInvisiblySmallElement](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#isInvisiblySmallElement) helper:

    ```ts
    const getSyncableElements = (elements: readonly ExcalidrawElement[]) =>
      elements.filter((el) => el.isDeleted || !isInvisiblySmallElement(el));
    ```

### Build

- Add vendor prefixes to css rules [#3476](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3476).

## Types

- Renamed the following types in case you depend on them (via [#3427](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3427)):
  - `DataState` → `ExportedDataState`
  - `LibraryData` → `ExportedLibraryData`

## Excalidraw Library

### Features

- Support tab-to-indent when editing text [#3411](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3411).

- App now breaks into mobile view using the component dimensions, not viewport dimensions. This fixes a case where the app would break sooner than necessary when the component's size is smaller than viewport [#3414](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3414).

- Add screenshots to manifest.json [#3369](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3369).

- Enable drop event on the whole component [#3406](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3406).

### Fixes

- Focus on last active element when dialog closes [#3447](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3447).

- Fix incorrectly caching png file handle [#3407](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3407).

- Fix popover position incorrect on Safari for non-zero offsets/scroll [#3399](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3399).

---

## 0.6.0 (2021-04-04)

## Excalidraw API

### Features

- Add `UIOptions` prop to customise `canvas actions` which includes customising `background color picker`, `clear canvas`, `export`, `load`, `save`, `save as` & `theme toggle` [#3364](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3364). Check the [readme](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#uioptions) for more details.
- Calculate `width/height` of canvas based on excalidraw component (".excalidraw" selector) & also resize and update offsets whenever the dimensions of excalidraw component gets updated [#3379](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3379). You also don't need to add a resize handler anymore for excalidraw as its handled now in excalidraw itself.
  #### BREAKING CHANGE
  - `width/height` props have been removed. Instead now it takes `100%` of `width` and `height` of the container so you need to make sure the container in which you are rendering Excalidraw has non zero dimensions (It should have non zero width and height so Excalidraw can match the dimensions of containing block)
- Calculate offsets when excalidraw container resizes using resize observer api [#3374](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3374).
- Export types for the package so now it can be used with typescript [#3337](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3337). The types are available at `@excalidraw/excalidraw/types`.
- Add `renderCustomStats` prop to render extra stats on host, and expose `setToastMessage` API via refs which can be used to show toast with custom message [#3360](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3360).
- Support passing a CSRF token when importing libraries to prevent prompting before installation. The token is passed from [https://libraries.excalidraw.com](https://libraries.excalidraw.com/) using the `token` URL key [#3329](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3329).
- #### BREAKING CHANGE
  Use `location.hash` when importing libraries to fix installation issues. This will require host apps to add a `hashchange` listener and call the newly exposed `excalidrawAPI.importLibrary(url)` API when applicable [#3320](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3320). Check the [readme](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#importlibrary) for more details.
- Append `location.pathname` to `libraryReturnUrl` default url [#3325](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3325).
- Support image elements [#3424](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3424).

### Build

- Expose separate builds for dev and prod and support source maps in dev build [#3330](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3330). Check the [readme](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#installation) for more details.
  #### BREAKING CHANGE
  - If you are using script tag to embed excalidraw then the name of the file will have to be updated to `excalidraw.production.min.js` instead of `excalidraw.min.js`. If you want to use dev build you can use `excalidraw.development.js`

### Refactor

#### BREAKING CHANGE

- Rename the API `setCanvasOffsets` exposed via [`ref`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/components/App.tsx#L265) to `refresh` [#3398](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3398).

## Excalidraw Library

### Features

- Reopen library menu on import from file [#3383](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3383).
- Don't unnecessarily prompt when installing libraries [#3329](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3329).
- Add option to flip single element on the context menu [#2520](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2520).
- Replace fontSize and fontFamily text with icons [#2857](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2857).

### Fixes

- Export dialog canvas positioning [#3397](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3397).
- Don't share collab types with core [#3353](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3353).
- Support d&d of files without extension [#3168](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3168).
- Positions stats for linear elements [#3331](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3331).
- Debounce.flush invokes func even if never queued before [#3326](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3326).
- State selection state on opening contextMenu [#3333](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3333).
- Add unique key for library header to resolve dev warnings [#3316](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3316).
- disallow create text in viewMode on mobile [#3219](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3219).
- Make help toggle tabbable [#3310](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3310)
- Show Windows share icon for Windows users [#3306](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3306).
- Don't scroll to content on INIT websocket message [#3291](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3291).

### Refactor

- Use arrow function where possible [#3315](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3315).

---

## 0.5.0 (2021-03-21)

## Excalidraw API

### Features

- Set the target to `window.name` if present during excalidraw libraries installation so it opens in same tab for the host. If `window.name` is not set it will open in a new tab [#3299](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3299).
- Add `name` prop to indicate the name of the drawing which will be used when exporting the drawing. When supplied, the value takes precedence over `intialData.appState.name`, the `name` will be fully controlled by host app and the users won't be able to edit from within Excalidraw [#3273](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3273).
- Export API `setCanvasOffsets` via `ref` to set the offsets for Excalidraw[#3265](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3265).
  #### BREAKING CHANGE
  - `offsetLeft` and `offsetTop` props have been removed now so you have to use the `setCanvasOffsets` via `ref` to achieve the same.
- Export API to export the drawing to canvas, svg and blob [#3258](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3258). For more info you can check the [readme](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/tree/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#user-content-export-utils)
- Add a `theme` prop to indicate Excalidraw's theme. [#3228](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3228). When this prop is passed, the theme is fully controlled by host app.
- Support `libraryReturnUrl` prop to indicate what URL to install libraries to [#3227](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3227).

### Refactor

- #### BREAKING CHANGE
  - Rename prop `initialData.scrollToCenter` and `setScrollToCenter` API exposed via ref to `initialData.scrollToContent` and `setScrollToContent` respectively[#3261](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3261).
- Rename appearance to theme [#3237](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/3237).
  #### BREAKING CHANGE
  - Since `appState.appearance` is renamed to `appState.theme` so wherever `appState.appearance` including `initialData.appState.appearance` should be renamed to `appState.theme` and `initialData.appState.theme` respectively. If the `appearance` was persisted earlier, now it needs to passed as `theme`.
  - The class `Appearance_dark` is renamed to `theme--dark`.
  - The class `Appearance_dark-background-none` is renamed to `theme--dark-background-none`.

## Excalidraw Library

## 0.2.1

## Excalidraw API

### Build

- Bundle css files with js [#2819](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2819). The host would not need to import css files separately.

## 0.2.0

## Excalidraw API

### Features

- Exported few [Extra API's](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#extra-apis) which can be used by the host to communicate with Excalidraw.

- Remove language picker, and add `langCode`, `renderFooter` [#2644](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2644):
  - BREAKING: removed the language picker from UI. It is now the host app's responsibility to implement a language picker if desirable, using the newly added [`renderFooter`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#renderFooter) prop. The reasoning is that the i18n should be controlled by the app itself, not by the nested Excalidraw component.
  - Added [`langCode`](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/master/src/packages/excalidraw/README.md#langCode) prop to control the UI language.
- Add support for `exportToBackend` prop to allow host apps to implement shareable links [#2612](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2612/files)
