I'll create a PHP application for you! Since you didn't specify which project, I'll create a popular beginner-friendly application - a **Todo App** with full CRUD functionality.I've created a fully functional **PHP Todo App** with the following features:

## ✨ Features:
- ➕ **Add new tasks** with a simple form
- ✅ **Mark tasks as complete/incomplete** by clicking checkboxes
- 🗑️ **Delete individual tasks**
- 📊 **Statistics dashboard** showing total, pending, and completed tasks
- 🧹 **Clear all completed tasks** at once
- 🕐 **Timestamps** for when each task was created
- 💾 **Session-based storage** (tasks persist during your browser session)

## 🎨 Design:
- Modern gradient background
- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Responsive layout
- Clean and intuitive interface

## 💡 How to use:
1. Save this code as `todo.php`
2. Place it in your web server directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP)
3. Access it through your browser (e.g., `http://localhost/todo.php`)
4. Start adding and managing your tasks!

The app uses PHP sessions to store tasks, so they'll persist as long as your browser session is active. Would you like me to create a different project from the list, or add database functionality to this one?
